%DELETED PARTS:
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\subsection{Source files organization}
Most header files included throughout the kernel code are located in the \verb|include/linux| directory. The architecture independent core logic of the kernel can be found in \verb|kernel|. Some of the source files located here have a 1-1 correspondence with the header files in \verb|./include/linux|, in general all these headers will get included within these source files.\\
Some of the most important folders found in the root directory are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textit{arch}

Architecture dependent code, with a subdirectory for each supported architecture. Most of the assembly code can be found here, there are no assembly files because all of the assembly code is inserted inline in C source files. This is a feature of \verb|gcc| which allows to insert arbitrary assembly in the code by using the builtin function \verb|__asm__()|. %how much percent?
\item \textit{drivers}

Device drivers, most of the kernel code is located here. Because of this, Linux can run on most systems without the need of additional, manually installed drivers (except for proprietary drivers, depending on the distribution). As of today this folder alone represents 60\% of the source code.
\item \textit{fs}

Filesystem and Virtual File System implementation. Block devices code is located in \textit{block}.
\item \textit{include}

Header files.
\item \textit{init}

TODO init routine executed in user space...
\item \textit{ipc}

All of the interprocess communication mechanisms are implemented here.
\item \textit{kernel}

Most of the kernel core logic and architecture independent code. Some of the subdirectories correspond to whole subsystems or parts of core kernel mechanisms, Some examples are: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{sched} - Scheduling
    \item \textit{irq} - Interrupts
    \item \textit{trace} - Function and event tracing
    \item \textit{locking} - Synchronization
    \item \textit{time} - Jiffies and HRT (high resolution times)
\end{itemize}
There are also source files in the main directory that implement important functions such as \verb|fork.c|, \verb|exit.c|, \verb|pid.c|, \verb|panic.c| and \verb|sysctl.c|.
\item \textit{mm}

Memory management code. It contains the logic behind pagination, memory mapping, virtual memory and memory allocation. It's here that the SLUB allocator code lives, its job is to allocate memory for kernel threads while minimizing fragmentation. %check this
\item \textit{net}

All the protocols used for networking and the network stack are implemented here.
\end{itemize}
The code that we will see is located mostly in the \verb|include|,  \verb|kernel|, and \verb|kernel/sched| directories. This is architecture independent code and its headers, as expected from the code that implements process scheduling. As we will see later there is actually a very small piece of architecture dependent code: the function to get the address of the currently running process on a CPU.
